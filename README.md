# Caleb Gindelberger
Hello! This GitHub page is a portfolio of projects I've done personally or for school that don't make sense and/or can't be put on my school portfolio.

I'm a 12th grader at the Dayton Regional STEM School. I'm interested in binary reverse engineering and programming. I'm doing a lot better at NCL this year than I have in years past, so I might post a writeup or something later.

You can contact me at gindelberger.2@daytonstemschool.org.
